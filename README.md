Vision

The main idea of the  Team WASSUP is to  appreciate the creativity, hardwork and dedication of the amazing talent of our society.
To provide them a platform where they can showcase their unique style in a better way.

Our website majorly aims at uplifting small retailers with less followers and background support. 
Our main focus is to reach out to people producing handmade and customised products, these maybe gifts, decorative items, craft items, stationeries and other homemade accessories.

With our website we would be able to provide wide spread reach to our local retailers and help them reach out customers beyond their confined circles.

Honour and give importance to their handmade craft and skills thereby promoting them through our website.

Help them receive worldwide acknowledgement and appreciation for their skills and potential

It's just a small initiative by us to help them reach out the heights they actually deserve.
