                <p class="mis-content">The major mission of our project is to uplift the small retailers selling their
                    products through various social media means like Instagram and Facebook.
                    <br>
                    These people are work hard extensively but unfortunately, despite of immense hard work they don't
                    get much attention and importance through these platform. Thus, our website aims at providing them
                    with a platform of their own that can uplift them and help them reach more and more public who are
                    genuinely interested in their products.

                <p class="vis-content">Our website majorly aims at uplifting small retailers with less followers and
                    background support. Our main focus was to reach out to people producing handmade and customised
                    products, these maybe gifts, decorative items, craft items, stationeries and other homemade
                    accessories.

                    # With our website we would be able to provide wide spread reach to our local retailers and help
                    them reach out customers beyond their confined circles.
                    <br>
                    # Honour and give importance to their handmade craft and skills thereby promoting them through our
                    website.

                    # Help them receive worldwide acknowledgement and appreciation for their skills and potential.
                    <br>
                    It's just a small initiative by us to help them reach out the heights they actually deserve.
